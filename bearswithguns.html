						<h1>Bears with Guns</h1>
						<p>Bears with Guns is a couch co-op twin stick shooter made for my Summer Studio class in the summer of 2021. It was in development at the same time as EDEN and Thriller Theater, with a team of around eight and made in about a month and a half. The game is about a group of heavily armed bears out to steal honey from bees, painting themselves red as a form of camouflage. Bears with Guns is a vertical slice of an initially larger scope, and showcases fairly smart AI, stealth and combat systems, and multiple playable classes with up to four players.</p>

						<h2>Architecture Overview</h1>
						<p>Early on in development I created an outline the basic class strucutre that the game, and importantly the interactible objects would take. Firstly there is the Player, which persists through scenes, and holds a log the UID of any Clickable objects's that have been interacted with. It also is the parent of the persistent UI, and thus is the main interface to UI functions, like adding inventory items. Other classes can access those functions through a Player singleton, which also serves as letting us add other player objects to test in different scenes without having them interact with each other.</p>
